# Y.js Chat App

## Run Locally

Run `./start` in the root of the repository. A recent version of Node.js is required.

This starts a Y.js server using the Websocket protocol as well as the front-end site using Vite.

Visit the site by navigating to (by default) `http://localhost:5173/`. If this URL does not work, check the console to see if Vite deployed to a different localhost port.
